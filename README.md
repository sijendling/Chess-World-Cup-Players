# Chess-World-Cup-Players
When I was looking at Chess World Cup 2023 page in wikipedia, an idea crossed my mind,
the idea of this program that stores all participants of the World Cup in a database. 
Without additional work, I just implemented my idea. Of course, it needs more features, 
which I plan to add them before the end of the World Cup!

V1:
You just have to install "requirements.txt" file libraries and Run the programm.
Programm will make a ".db" file and store players' name, country and rating in a table named "Participants"
